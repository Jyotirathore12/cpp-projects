##  Features
The program can analyze a number and check whether it is:
- Prime or not
- Even or odd
- Palindrome
- Armstrong number
- Perfect number
- Strong number (optional extension)



##  Concepts Used
- Functions in C++
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional statements
- Number manipulation
- Modular programming
- Time complexity basics
- Input validation



##  How It Works
1. User inputs a number
2. Program calls different functions to analyze properties
3. Each property is checked independently
4. Results are displayed clearly to the user



##  How to Run (Windows / PowerShell)

## Compile
```powershell
g++ main.cpp -o smart_number_analyzer
